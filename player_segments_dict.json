All suggested items are existing in-game assets and do not require new designs or adjustments to game balance.\n\n---\n\n## Bundle Details\n\n### 1. Bundle Name\n\u201cDetonation Specialist Bundle\u201d\n\n### 2. Bundle Price\n$9.99 USD (or equivalent in your regional pricing)\n\n### 3.

The in-game currency included helps them refuel or repair mid-battle. This recommendation is most effective during high-stakes events such as the End War, where the short lifespan of a kamikaze build can yield outsized battlefield impact.\n\n---\n\n## Product Experiment Instructions\n\n1. A/B Test Pricing and Composition  \n   \u2022 Test a base version at $9.99 with the items listed above.  \n   \u2022 Compare against a variant at $7.99 with slightly fewer Explosive Potions (e.g., 8 instead of 10) to see which generates higher uptake among Sacrificial Lambs players.\n\n2. Promotion Timing  \n   \u2022 Schedule the bundle to appear prominently a week before End War events and continue until the event concludes. Compare conversion rates during End War vs. off-season to validate timing impact.\n\n3. Messaging  \n   \u2022 Draw attention to the explosive potential of the bundle in marketing copy.  \n   \u2022 Emphasize how the included gear can fulfill so-called \u201cKamikaze Contracts\u201d goals without requiring new game features or changes.\n\n4. Measurement KPIs  \n   \u2022 Conversion Rate: How many players in this segment purchase the bundle.  \n   \u2022 Engagement Duration: Whether players return more frequently to participate in high-risk strategies.  \n   \u2022 Repeat Purchases: Track if these players rebuy a similar bundle in future seasons or events.\n\n5. No New Asset Creation or Balance Changes  \n   \u2022 All contents are existing items; no new mechanics or level adjustments are introduced.  \n   \u2022 Verify that current game assets and currencies support these purchases without requiring extra development.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe \u201cDetonation Specialist Bundle\u201d uses only existing items and mechanics, primarily catering to players who adopt suicide builds for disruptive power. By following these product experiment instructions and closely monitoring KPIs, you can refine the offer for maximum appeal to the Sacrificial Lambs segment without introducing any new game designs or assets. \n\n---\n\n_End of Report_"
